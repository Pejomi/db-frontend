                The considerations for a hosting database would focus on scalability, given the global scope of the data, and flexibility, to accommodate various data types and relationships.

            children: <>
                For scaling, a schema that can handle both structured and semi-structured data is ideal. NoSQL databases e.g. MongoDB offer flexibility and scalability, suitable for varied data types and volumes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Data can be partitioned based on geographical regions, like country, or reporting years to distribute the load evenly across servers, enhancing query performance as the database grows.

                We spent too much time on preprocessing the data, because it was not compatible to be ingested into the database. We tried some different strategies for handling the logic. We started with Java, but quickly realized that Python was more suitable for handling the CSV files etc. We are using MsSql, but we also considered using MySql as an alternative. We came to the conclusion that MsSql was the better choice. We like the Database management system that Microsoft provides, because of features like fragmentation and performance reports.
                <br />
                <br />
                We believe that we have a solution that can be used for the next assignment which is about MongoDB.
